# Desktop UI — selected dark direction

Implemented in the existing Avalonia desktop client. Neutral charcoal surfaces, a quiet violet active marker, server rail, grouped channel navigation, channel tabs, message timeline, member sidebar and account strip follow `selected-reference.png`. The native OS owns window controls; no fake traffic lights are drawn.

## Run

```sh
dotnet run --project src/client/App -c Release -- --design-preview
```

The explicit `--design-preview` flag loads bounded local UI fixtures, marks the window and account area as **设计预览**, skips instance/cache hydration, and blocks adding instances. No fixture data enters Core, the network, or SQLite. Preview channel/tab navigation, current-channel text search, group collapse and member visibility work locally. Sending, reactions, attachment/emoji actions, account settings and voice actions show **Not implemented yet**; drafts are preserved and no message or media success is invented.

Normal startup (without the flag) retains real instance discovery/cache behavior and shows no sample channels, people, avatars or messages. New users see the styled add-instance screen. This is UI work, not an advancement of chat/RTC backend implementation.

## Components and assets

- `Shell/MainWindow`: layout and shared transient notice only.
- `Instances`: real instance rail and add-instance form; explicit preview server visuals.
- `Channels/ChannelSidebar`: grouped navigation.
- `Workspace`: tabs, conversation, member and account views with presentation state.
- `Styles/Theme.axaml`: dark tokens and focus/hover/selection presentation.
- `Styles/Icons.axaml`: official Microsoft Fluent System Icons geometries; MIT license in `Assets`.
- Five generated avatars are stored at 256px; the preview owns five 128px decoded bitmaps and disposes them at application exit. Normal mode does not decode them.
- The timeline uses Avalonia ListBox's virtualizing panel. Preview fixtures are bounded at five messages; real paging belongs to the future message pipeline.

## Verification

Release desktop build: zero warnings/errors. Client dependency boundaries pass. One native macOS visual smoke session covered populated preview and isolated empty normal startup. Seven focused presentation-state checks covered fixture isolation, loading, synchronized selection, search, member visibility, explicit unimplemented send/draft retention and notice dismissal.

Native OS mouse/keyboard automation was unavailable: the computer-use runtime could not start after the workspace move, and System Events denied accessibility. State checks do not establish OS input, screen-reader, Windows/Linux or chat/RTC acceptance. No deployment, SSH, microphone access or server changes were performed for this UI task.

See `../../design-qa.md` for the visual comparison and screenshot evidence.
